# React + TypeScript + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

# React TypeScript (TSX) Project Setup Guide

## Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed:

---

## Steps to Set Up the Project

1. **Install Dependencies**

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. **Verify TypeScript Configuration**

   Ensure `tsconfig.json` exists in the root directory. Modify it if needed to match project requirements.

3. **Start the Development Server**

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

   This will start the React app in development mode. Open [http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173) to view it in the browser.

Follow these steps to get your React TypeScript project up and running efficiently!
